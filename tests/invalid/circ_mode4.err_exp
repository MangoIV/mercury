circ_mode4.m:014: Mode name `circ1'/1 expands to a mode containing itself,
circ_mode4.m:014:   which means that processing any reference to it would
circ_mode4.m:014:   require an infinite sequence of expansions.
circ_mode4.m:015: Mode name `circ2'/1 expands to a mode containing itself,
circ_mode4.m:015:   which means that processing any reference to it would
circ_mode4.m:015:   require an infinite sequence of expansions.
circ_mode4.m:017: Mode name `left'/1 expands to a mode containing itself
circ_mode4.m:017:   through `right'/1, which means that processing any
circ_mode4.m:017:   reference to it would require an infinite sequence of
circ_mode4.m:017:   expansions.
circ_mode4.m:018:   The definition of `right'/1 is here.
