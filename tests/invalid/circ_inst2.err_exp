circ_inst2.m:014: Inst name `circ1'/1 expands to an inst containing itself,
circ_inst2.m:014:   which means that processing any reference to it would
circ_inst2.m:014:   require an infinite sequence of expansions.
circ_inst2.m:015: Inst name `circ2'/1 expands to an inst containing itself,
circ_inst2.m:015:   which means that processing any reference to it would
circ_inst2.m:015:   require an infinite sequence of expansions.
circ_inst2.m:017: Inst name `circ4'/1 expands to an inst containing itself,
circ_inst2.m:017:   which means that processing any reference to it would
circ_inst2.m:017:   require an infinite sequence of expansions.
circ_inst2.m:019: Inst name `left'/1 expands to an inst containing itself
circ_inst2.m:019:   through `right'/1, which means that processing any
circ_inst2.m:019:   reference to it would require an infinite sequence of
circ_inst2.m:019:   expansions.
circ_inst2.m:020:   The definition of `right'/1 is here.
