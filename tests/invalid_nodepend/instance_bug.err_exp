instance_bug.m:013: Error: non-abstract instance declaration in module
instance_bug.m:013:   interface.
instance_bug.m:013:   The usual fix for this problem is to move this instance
instance_bug.m:013:   declaration to the implementation section, replacing it
instance_bug.m:013:   in the interface section with its abstract version, which
instance_bug.m:013:   contains just the class name and the instance type
instance_bug.m:013:   vector.
